# Exercise 2: Getting Started with Azure Arc enabled data services 

Duration: - 

In this exercise, you will get familiar with the existing Kubernetes cluster and connect to the data controller and verify the status 

## Task 1: Getting started with the existing Kubernetes cluster 

1. 

## Task 2: Connect to the data controller using Azure Data Studio/ Azure CLI.

In this task you will learn how to connect to the data controller using Azure Data Studio

1. On your LabVM  launch a **Command Prompt** window (Select search on the task bar, type cmd, and select Enter).

1. Enter the following command at the command prompt.

   ```BASH
      azdata login
   ```
   
   ![](./images/azdata.png "azdata")
   
1. When prompted enter the Namespace, you can find the Namespace from the Environment details page. Copy the data controller service API endpoint URL value from the output.

   ![](./images/namespace.png "namespace")
   
   ![](./images/endpoint.png "endpoint")

1. Now on your LabVM open **Azure Data studio** and select **Connections**.

   ![](./images/connection.png "Connection")
   
1. In **Connections** panel under **Azure Arc Controllers** click on Connect Controller.

1. In **Connect to Controller** page enter the following details and click on **Connect**.

   - **Controller URL**: Enter the data controller service API endpoint URL value which you copied earlier 
   
   - **Name** : Enter arcdc
   
   - **Username** : Enter acdcuser
   
   - **Password** : Enter Password.1!!
   
     ![](./images/connection1.png "")
    
1. Once Connection is successful, you can see arc data controller listed under Arc Controllers.

## Task 3: Monitor with Data Controller Dashboard

Now that you are connected to a data controller, you can view the dashboards for the data controller and any SQL managed instances or PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group resources that you have.

1. In the **Connections** panel, under **Arc Controllers** right-click on the  arcdc data controller and select **Manage**.

1. In the Azure Arc Data Controller dashboard, you can see details about the data controller resource such as name, region, connection mode, resource group, subscription, controller endpoint, and namespace.
