# Exercise 4: Azure Arc enabled SQL Managed Instance

Duration: - 180 mins

In this exercise, you will create a SQL Managed Instance

## Task 1: Create SQL Managed Instance 

1. In the Azure Arc Data Controller dashboard, click on **+ New Instance**.

1. From the deployment options balde, select **Azure SQL managed instance - Azure Arc**. Accept the Privacy and license terms and click **Select** at the button.

1. In the Deploy **Azure SQL managed instance - Azure Arc blade**, enter the following information:

   **Under SQL Connection information**
   
   - **Instance name**: Enter arcsql
   
   - **Username**:  Enter arcsqluser
   
   - **Password**: Enter Password.1!!
   
   **SQL Instance settings**
  
   - **Core Request**: Enter 2
   
   - **Core Limit**: Enter 2.5
   
   - **Memory Request**: Enter 2.5
   
   - **Memory Limit**: Enter 2.5
   
     ![](images/sql-instance1.png "Confirm")
     
1. Click the **Deploy** button, this will start the deployment of the  **Azure SQL managed instance - Azure Arc** on the data controller.

1. The deployment of **Azure SQL managed instance - Azure Arc** will take about 10 minutes to complete, in this time you can explore through the commands in the notebook.

1. Once the installation is complete, in **Azure Arc Data Controller dashboard** under Azure Arc Resources you can see the newly created Azure Arc enabled SQL Managed Instance.

## Task 2: Connect to Azure Arc enabled SQL Managed Instance

In this task, you will learn how to connect to your newly created Azure Arc enabled SQL Managed Instance using Data Studio

1. In the **Azure Arc Data Controller dashboard**, under Azure Arc Resources click on your newly created SQL Managed Instance this will open  **SQL managed instance - Azure Arc Data Controller dashboard**.

1. Now in the **SQL managed instance - Azure Arc Data Controller dashboard**, copy the external endpoint value. 

1. In the Data studio page, in connections blade under servers click on **New Connection**.

1. Enter the following in the connection details page and click on **Connect**.

   - **Connection type** : Select Microsoft SQL Server
   
   - **Sever** : Paste the external end point value which you copied earlier
   
   - **Authentication type** : Select SQL Login
   
   - **User name** : Enter arcsqluser
   
   - **Password** : Enter Password.1!!
   
1. Now under servers you can see that you are successfully connected with your Azure Arc enabled SQL MI Server.

## Task 3: Restore: Restore Adventure Works DB to SQL MI Instance

In this task you will download the sample backup file i.e AdventureWorks backup (.bak) into your SQL Managed Instance container and then restore the AdventureWorks database.

1. On your LabVM launch a **Command Prompt** window (Select search on the task bar, type cmd, and select Enter).

1. In the Command Prompt, run the following command to get the lis of pods that are running on your data controller. Copy the pod name of SQL MI instance from the output.

   > **Note** : Please make sure to replace the namespace name with your data controller namespace name

   ```BASH
    kubectl get pods -n <your namespace name>
   ```
   
1. In the Command Prompt, run the following command. This will remotely execute a command inside of the SQL Managed Instance container to download the .bak file into the container. 

   >**Note** : Replace the value of the namespace name and pod name with the value you copied in the previous step.

   ```BASH
   kubectl exec <SQL pod name> -n <your namespace name> -c arc-sqlmi -- wget https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks2019.bak -O /var/opt/mssql/data/AdventureWorks2019.bak
   ```

1. Now to restore the AdventureWorks database run the following command.

   > **Note** : Ensure to replace the value of the pod name, namespace name and the password before you run it.

   ```BASH
   kubectl exec <SQL pod name> -n <your namespace name> -c arc-sqlmi -- /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P <password> -Q "RESTORE DATABASE AdventureWorks2019 FROM  DISK = N'/var/opt/mssql/data/AdventureWorks2019.bak' WITH MOVE 'AdventureWorks2017' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/AdventureWorks2019.mdf', MOVE 'AdventureWorks2017_Log' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/AdventureWorks2019_Log.ldf'"
   ```

1. Now switch back to Azure Data Studio, Right click on the SQLMI Server and click on refresh, then expand your SQL MI server, expand Databases and verify that AdventureWorks2019 DB is listed.

## Task 4: Migrate: Migrate and Restore DB to Azure Arc enabled SQL Managed Instance from Blob storage and Azure arc pod.

1. Login to Azure Portal and goto your lab environment RG, you will be able to find Azure blob storage name as acrblobstorageSUFFIX, open that and click on the Access keys button from the left side menu. now click on Show keys button to get the keys.

   ![](images/keys.png "Confirm")

2. Now you will be able to see the storage account name and storage account keys. Copy the storage account name and key1 from the portal and save in a notepad. we will use these values in later steps.
